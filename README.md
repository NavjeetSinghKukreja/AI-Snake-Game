# AI Snake Game

This project is an implementation of the classic **Snake game** with an AI agent that learns to play using **Reinforcement Learning**.

## Features
- **Snake Game:** Traditional Snake game built using `Pygame`.
- **AI Agent:** The AI agent is trained using `Q-Learning` with `PyTorch`.

## How It Works
The AI agent interacts with the environment by moving up, down, left, or right. It learns by receiving rewards (eating food, avoiding walls, etc.) and improving its actions using the **Q-Learning** algorithm.

## Technologies Used
- `Python`
- `Pygame`
- `PyTorch`
